   1. Provision of the Services.
       1.1 Services Use. Subject to this Agreement, during the Term,
       Customer may: (a) use the Services, (b) integrate the Services into
       any Application that has material value independent of the
       Services, and (c) use any Software provided by Google as part of
       the Services. Customer may not sublicense or transfer these rights
       except as permitted under the Assignment section of the Agreement.
       1.2 Console. Google will provide the Services to Customer. As part
       of receiving the Services, Customer will have access to the Admin
       Console, through which Customer may administer the Services.
       1.3 Facilities. All facilities used to store and process an
       Application and Customer Data will adhere to reasonable security
       standards no less protective than the security standards at
       facilities where Google processes and stores its own information of
       a similar type. Google has implemented at least industry standard
       systems and procedures to (i) ensure the security and
       confidentiality of an Application and Customer Data, (ii) protect
       against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity
       of an Application and Customer Data, and (iii) protect against
       unauthorized access to or use of an Application and Customer Data.
       1.4 Data Location. Customer may select where certain Customer Data
       will be stored ("Data Location Selection"), and Google will store
       it there in accordance with the Service Specific Terms. If a Data
       Location Selection is not covered by the Service Specific Terms (or
       a Data Location Selection is not made by Customer with respect to
       any Customer Data), Google may process and store the Customer Data
       anywhere Google or its agents maintain facilities. By using the
       Services, Customer consents to this processing and storage of
       Customer Data.
       1.5 Accounts. Customer must have an Account and a Token (if
       applicable) to use the Services, and is responsible for the
       information it provides to create the Account, the security of the
       Token and its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its
       Account and the Token. If Customer becomes aware of any
       unauthorized use of its password, its Account or the Token,
       Customer will notify Google as promptly as possible. Google has no
       obligation to provide Customer multiple Tokens or Accounts.
       1.6 New Applications and Services. Google may: (i) make new
       applications, tools, features or functionality available from time
       to time through the Services and (ii) add new services to the
       "Services" definition from time to time (by adding them at the URL
       set forth under that definition), the use of which may be
       contingent upon Customer's agreement to additional terms.
       1.7 Modifications.
       a. To the Services. Google may make commercially reasonable updates
       to the Services from time to time. If Google makes a material
       change to the Services, Google will inform Customer, provided that
       Customer has subscribed with Google to be informed about such
       change.
       b. To the Agreement. Google may make changes to this Agreement,
       including pricing (and any linked documents) from time to time.
       Unless otherwise noted by Google, material changes to the Agreement
       will become effective 30 days after they are posted, except if the
       changes apply to new functionality in which case they will be
       effective immediately. Google will provide at least 90 days'
       advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by
       either: (i) sending an email to Customer's primary point of
       contact; (ii) posting a notice in the Admin Console; or (iii)
       posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer does
       not agree to the revised Agreement, please stop using the Services.
       Google will post any modification to this Agreement to the Terms
       URL.
       c. To the Data Processing and Security Terms. Google may only
       change the Data Processing and Security Terms where such change is
       required to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation,
       court order, or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or
       agency, where such change is expressly permitted by the Data
       Processing and Security Terms, or where such change:
       (i) is commercially reasonable;
       (ii) does not result in a degradation of the overall security of
       the Services;
       (iii) does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on
       Google's processing of Customer Personal Data, as described in
       Section 5.2 (Scope of Processing) of the Data Processing and
       Security Terms; and
       (iv) does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on
       Customer's rights under the Data Processing and Security Terms.
       If Google makes a material change to the Data Processing and
       Security Terms in accordance with this Section, Google will post
       the modification to the URL containing those terms.
       1.8 Service Specific Terms and Data Processing and Security Terms.
       The Service Specific Terms and Data Processing and Security Terms
       are incorporated by this reference into the Agreement.
       2. Payment Terms.
       2.1 Free Quota. Certain Services are provided to Customer without
       charge up to the Fee Threshold, as applicable.
       2.2 Online Billing. At the end of the applicable Fee Accrual
       Period, Google will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all
       charges accrued above the Fee Threshold based on (i) Customer's use
       of the Services during the previous Fee Accrual Period (including,
       if any, the relevant Fee for TSS set forth in the Fees definition
       below); (ii) any Reserved Units selected; (iii) any Committed
       Purchases selected; and/or (iv) any Package Purchases selected. For
       use above the Fee Threshold, Customer will be responsible for all
       Fees up to the amount set in the Account and will pay all Fees in
       the currency set forth in the invoice. If Customer elects to pay by
       credit card, debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment,
       Google will charge (and Customer will pay) all Fees immediately at
       the end of the Fee Accrual Period. If Customer elects to pay by
       invoice (and Google agrees), all Fees are due as set forth in the
       invoice. Customer's obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable.
       Google's measurement of Customer's use of the Services is final.
       Google has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments made
       via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by
       Google. If Customer has entered into the Agreement with GCL, Google
       may collect payments via Google Payment Limited, a company
       incorporated in England and Wales with offices at Belgrave House,
       76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9TQ, United Kingdom.
       2.3 Taxes. (a) Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer
       will pay Google for the Services without any reduction for Taxes.
       If Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be
       invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides Google with a timely
       and valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate
       taxing authority. In some states the sales tax is due on the total
       purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and
       collected at the time of the sale. If Customer is required by law
       to withhold any Taxes from its payments to Google, Customer must
       provide Google with an official tax receipt or other appropriate
       documentation to support such withholding. If under the applicable
       tax legislation the Services are subject to local VAT and the
       Customer is required to make a withholding of local VAT from
       amounts payable to Google, the value of Services calculated in
       accordance with the above procedure will be increased (grossed up)
       by the Customer for the respective amount of local VAT and the
       grossed up amount will be regarded as a VAT inclusive price. Local
       VAT amount withheld from the VAT-inclusive price will be remitted
       to the applicable local tax entity by the Customer and Customer
       will ensure that Google will receives payment for its services for
       the net amount as would otherwise be due (the VAT inclusive price
       less the local VAT withheld and remitted to applicable tax
       authority).
       (b) If required under applicable law, Customer will provide Google
       with applicable tax identification information that Google may
       require to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations
       and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be
       liable to pay (or reimburse Google for) any taxes, interest,
       penalties or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by the
       Customer.
       2.4 Invoice Disputes & Refunds. Any invoice disputes must be
       submitted prior to the payment due date. If the parties determine
       that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Google,
       Google will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a
       credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected
       invoice. If the disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Google will
       apply the credit memo amount to the disputed invoice and Customer
       will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on
       that invoice. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer
       waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within sixty days
       after charged (this does not affect any Customer rights with its
       credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of
       Google and will only be in the form of credit for the Services.
       Nothing in this Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any
       party.
       2.5 Delinquent Payments; Suspension. Late payments may bear
       interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate
       permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in
       full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses
       (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Google in collecting such
       delinquent amounts. If Customer is late on payment for the
       Services, Google may Suspend the Services or terminate the
       Agreement for breach pursuant to Section 9.2.
       2.6 No Purchase Order Number Required. For clarity, Customer is
       obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for
       Google to provide a purchase order number on Google's invoice (or
       otherwise).
       3. Customer Obligations.
       3.1 Compliance. Customer is solely responsible for its
       Applications, Projects, and Customer Data and for making sure its
       Applications, Projects, and Customer Data comply with the AUP.
       Google reserves the right to review the Application, Project, and
       Customer Data for compliance with the AUP. Customer is responsible
       for ensuring all Customer End Users comply with Customer's
       obligations under the AUP, the Service Specific Terms, and the
       restrictions in Sections 3.3 and 3.5 below.
       3.2 Privacy. Customer will obtain and maintain any required
       consents necessary to permit the processing of Customer Data under
       this Agreement.
       3.3 Restrictions. Customer will not, and will not allow third
       parties under its control to: (a) copy, modify, create a derivative
       work of, reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or
       otherwise attempt to extract any or all of the source code of the
       Services (subject to Section 3.4 below and except to the extent
       such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (b)
       use the Services for High Risk Activities; (c) sublicense, resell,
       or distribute any or all of the Services separate from any
       integrated Application; (d) create multiple Applications, Accounts,
       or Projects to simulate or act as a single Application, Account, or
       Project (respectively) or otherwise access the Services in a manner
       intended to avoid incurring Fees or exceed usage limits or quotas;
       (e) unless otherwise set forth in the Service Specific Terms, use
       the Services to operate or enable any telecommunications service or
       in connection with any Application that allows Customer End Users
       to place calls or to receive calls from any public switched
       telephone network; or (f) process or store any Customer Data that
       is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
       maintained by the Department of State. Unless otherwise specified
       in writing by Google, Google does not intend uses of the Services
       to create obligations under HIPAA, and makes no representations
       that the Services satisfy HIPAA requirements. If Customer is (or
       becomes) a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in
       HIPAA, Customer will not use the Services for any purpose or in any
       manner involving Protected Health Information (as defined in HIPAA)
       unless Customer has received prior written consent to such use from
       Google.
       3.4 Third Party Components. Third party components (which may
       include open source software) of the Services may be subject to
       separate license agreements. To the limited extent a third party
       license expressly supersedes this Agreement, that third party
       license governs Customer's use of that third party component.
       3.5 Documentation. Google may provide Documentation for Customer's
       use of the Services. The Documentation may specify restrictions
       (e.g. attribution or HTML restrictions) on how the Applications may
       be built or the Services may be used and Customer will comply with
       any such restrictions specified.
       3.6 Copyright Policy. Google provides information to help copyright
       holders manage their intellectual property online, but Google
       cannot determine whether something is being used legally or not
       without their input. Google responds to notices of alleged
       copyright infringement and terminates accounts of repeat infringers
       according to applicable copyright laws including in particular the
       process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If
       Customer thinks somebody is violating Customer's or Customer End
       Users' copyrights and wants to notify Google, Customer can find
       information about submitting notices, and Google's policy about
       responding to notices at http://www.google.com/dmca.html.
       4. Suspension.
       4.1 AUP Violations. If Google becomes aware that Customer's or any
       Customer End User's use of the Services violates the AUP, Google
       will give Customer notice of the violation by requesting that
       Customer correct the violation. If Customer fails to correct the
       violation within 24 hours of Google's request, then Google may
       Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services until the
       violation is corrected.
       4.2 Other Suspension. Notwithstanding Section 4.1 (AUP Violations)
       Google may immediately Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the
       Services if: (a) Google believes Customer's or any Customer End
       User's use of the Services could adversely impact the Services,
       other customers' or their end users' use of the Services, or the
       Google network or servers used to provide the Services, which may
       include use of the Services for cryptocurrency mining without
       Google's prior written approval; (b) there is suspected
       unauthorized third-party access to the Services; (c) Google
       believes it is required to Suspend immediately to comply with
       applicable law; or (d) Customer is in breach of Section 3.3
       (Restrictions). Google will lift any such Suspension when the
       circumstances giving rise to the Suspension have been resolved. At
       Customer's request, unless prohibited by applicable law, Google
       will notify Customer of the basis for the Suspension as soon as is
       reasonably possible.
       5. Intellectual Property Rights; Use of Customer Data; Feedback;
       Benchmarking.
       5.1 Intellectual Property Rights. Except as expressly set forth in
       this Agreement, this Agreement does not grant either party any
       rights, implied or otherwise, to the other's content or any of the
       other's intellectual property. As between the parties, Customer
       owns all Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data and the
       Application or Project (if applicable), and Google owns all
       Intellectual Property Rights in the Services and Software.
       5.2 Use of Customer Data. Google will not access or use Customer
       Data, except as necessary to provide the Services and TSS to
       Customer.
       5.3 Customer Feedback. If Customer provides Google Feedback about
       the Services, then Google may use that information without
       obligation to Customer, and Customer hereby irrevocably assigns to
       Google all right, title, and interest in that Feedback.
       5.4 Benchmarking. Customer may not publicly disclose directly or
       through a third party the results of any comparative or
       compatibility testing, benchmarking, or evaluation (each, a "Test")
       of the Services, unless the disclosure includes all information
       necessary for Google or a third party to replicate the Test. If
       Customer conducts, or directs a third party to conduct, a Test of
       the Services and publicly discloses the results directly or through
       a third party, then Google (or a Google-directed third party) may
       conduct Tests of any publicly available products or services
       provided by Customer and publicly disclose the results of any such
       Test (which disclosure will include all information necessary for
       Customer or a third party to replicate the Test). To the extent
       this Section 5.4 conflicts with any other Customer product or
       service terms, this Section 5.4 will govern.
       6. Technical Support Services
       6.1 By Customer. Customer is responsible for technical support of
       its Applications and Projects.
       6.2 By Google. Subject to payment of applicable support Fees,
       Google will provide TSS to Customer during the Term in accordance
       with the TSS Guidelines. Certain TSS levels include a minimum
       recurring Fee as described in the "Fees" definition below. If
       Customer downgrades its TSS level during any calendar month, Google
       may continue to provide TSS at the same level and TSS Fees before
       the downgrade for the remainder of that month.
       7. Deprecation of Services
       7.1 Discontinuance of Services. Subject to Section 7.2, Google may
       discontinue any Services or any portion or feature for any reason
       at any time without liability to Customer.
       7.2 Deprecation Policy. Google will announce if it intends to
       discontinue or make backwards incompatible changes to the Services
       specified at the URL in the next sentence. Google will use
       commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate those
       Services versions and features identified at
       https://cloud.google.com/terms/deprecation without these changes
       for at least one year after that announcement, unless (as Google
       determines in its reasonable good faith judgment):
       (i) required by law or third party relationship (including if there
       is a change in applicable law or relationship), or
       (ii) doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic
       or material technical burden.
       The above policy is the "Deprecation Policy."
       8. Confidential Information.
       8.1 Obligations. The recipient will not disclose the Confidential
       Information, except to Affiliates, employees, agents or
       professional advisors who need to know it and who have agreed in
       writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise
       bound) to keep it confidential. The recipient will ensure that
       those people and entities use the received Confidential Information
       only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this
       Agreement, while using reasonable care to keep it confidential.
       8.2 Required Disclosure. Notwithstanding any provision to the
       contrary in this Agreement, the recipient may also disclose
       Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable Legal
       Process; provided that the recipient uses commercially reasonable
       efforts to: (i) promptly notify the other party of such disclosure
       before disclosing; and (ii) comply with the other party's
       reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the disclosure.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsections (i) and (ii) above will
       not apply if the recipient determines that complying with (i) and
       (ii) could: (a) result in a violation of Legal Process; (b)
       obstruct a governmental investigation; and/or (c) lead to death or
       serious physical harm to an individual. As between the parties,
       Customer is responsible for responding to all third party requests
       concerning its use and Customer End Users' use of the Services.
       9. Term and Termination.
       9.1 Agreement Term. The "Term" of this Agreement will begin on the
       Effective Date and continue until the Agreement is terminated as
       set forth in Section 9 of this Agreement.
       9.2 Termination for Breach. Either party may terminate this
       Agreement for breach if: (i) the other party is in material breach
       of the Agreement and fails to cure that breach within thirty days
       after receipt of written notice; (ii) the other party ceases its
       business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings
       and the proceedings are not dismissed within ninety days; or (iii)
       the other party is in material breach of this Agreement more than
       two times notwithstanding any cure of such breaches. In addition,
       Google may terminate any, all, or any portion of the Services or
       Projects, if Customer meets any of the conditions in Section
       9.2(i), (ii), and/or (iii).
       9.3 Termination for Inactivity.
       Google reserves the right to terminate the provision of the
       Service(s) to a Project upon 30 days advance notice if, for a
       period of 60 days (i) Customer has not accessed the Admin Console

       (b) GOOGLE AND ITS SUPPLIERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE
       DELETION OF OR FAILURE TO STORE ANY CUSTOMER DATA AND OTHER
       COMMUNICATIONS MAINTAINED OR TRANSMITTED THROUGH USE OF THE

       WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR LOST REVENUES OR INDIRECT,
       SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
       EVEN IF THE PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE
       POSSIBLE AND EVEN IF DIRECT DAMAGES DO NOT SATISFY A REMEDY.
       13.2 Limitation on Amount of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
       PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER PARTY, NOR GOOGLE'S SUPPLIERS,
       MAY BE HELD LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT
       PAID BY CUSTOMER TO GOOGLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE
       MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.
       13.3 Exceptions to Limitations. These limitations of liability do
       not apply to violations of a party's Intellectual Property Rights
       by the other party, indemnification obligations, or Customer's
       payment obligations.
       14. Indemnification.
       14.1 By Customer. Unless prohibited by applicable law, Customer
       will defend and indemnify Google and its Affiliates against
       Indemnified Liabilities in any Third-Party Legal Proceeding to the
       extent arising from: (i) any Application, Project, Instance,
       Customer Data or Customer Brand Features; or (ii) Customer's, or
       Customer End Users', use of the Services in violation of the AUP.
       14.2 By Google. Google will defend and indemnify Customer and its
       Affiliates against Indemnified Liabilities in any Third-Party Legal
       Proceeding to the extent arising solely from an Allegation that use
       of (a) Google's technology used to provide the Services or (b) any
       Google Brand Feature infringes or misappropriates the third party's
       patent, copyright, trade secret, or trademark.
       14.3 Exclusions. This Section 14 will not apply to the extent the
       underlying Allegation arises from:
       a. the indemnified party's breach of this Agreement;
       b. modifications to the indemnifying party's technology or Brand
       Features by anyone other than the indemnifying party;
       c. combination of the indemnifying party's technology or Brand
       Features with materials not provided by the indemnifying party; or
       d. use of non-current or unsupported versions of the Services or
       Brand Features;
       14.4 Conditions. Sections 14.1 and 14.2 will apply only to the
       extent:
       a. The indemnified party has promptly notified the indemnifying
       party in writing of any Allegation(s) that preceded the Third-Party
       Legal Proceeding and cooperates reasonably with the indemnifying
       party to resolve the Allegation(s) and Third-Party Legal
       Proceeding. If breach of this Section 14.4(a) prejudices the
       defense of the Third-Party Legal Proceeding, the indemnifying
       party's obligations under Section 14.1 or 14.2 (as applicable) will
       be reduced in proportion to the prejudice.
       b. The indemnified party tenders sole control of the indemnified
       portion of the Third-Party Legal Proceeding to the indemnifying
       party, subject to the following: (i) the indemnified party may
       appoint its own non-controlling counsel, at its own expense; and
       (ii) any settlement requiring the indemnified party to admit
       liability, pay money, or take (or refrain from taking) any action,
       will require the indemnified party's prior written consent, not to
       be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.
       14.5 Remedies.
       a. If Google reasonably believes the Services might infringe a
       third party's Intellectual Property Rights, then Google may, at its
       sole option and expense: (a) procure the right for Customer to
       continue using the Services; (b) modify the Services to make them
       non-infringing without materially reducing their functionality; or
       (c) replace the Services with a non-infringing, functionally
       equivalent alternative.
       b. If Google does not believe the remedies in Section 14.5(a) are
       commercially reasonable, then Google may Suspend or terminate
       Customer's use of the impacted Services.
       14.6 Sole Rights and Obligations. Without affecting either party's
       termination rights, this Section 14 states the parties' only rights
       and obligations under this Agreement for any third party's
       Intellectual Property Rights Allegations and Third-Party Legal
       Proceedings.
       15. U.S. Federal Agency Users. The Services were developed solely
       at private expense and are commercial computer software and related
       documentation within the meaning of the applicable Federal
       Acquisition Regulations and their agency supplements.
       16. Miscellaneous.

       other party's legal department and primary point of contact. The
       email address for notices being sent to Google's Legal Department

       by the terms of this Agreement; (b) the assigning party remains
       liable for obligations under the Agreement if the assignee defaults
       on them; and (c) the assigning party has notified the other party
       of the assignment. Any other attempt to assign is void.
       16.3 Change of Control. If a party experiences a change of Control
       (for example, through a stock purchase or sale, merger, or other
       form of corporate transaction): (a) that party will give written
       notice to the other party within thirty days after the change of
       Control; and (b) the other party may immediately terminate this
       Agreement any time between the change of Control and thirty days
       after it receives that written notice.
       16.4 Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for failure or
       delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond
       its reasonable control.
       16.5 No Agency. This Agreement does not create any agency,
       partnership or joint venture between the parties.

       under this Agreement.
